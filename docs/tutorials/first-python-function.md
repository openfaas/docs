# Your first OpenFaaS Function with Python

Let's write a Python function with [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) that executes hello-world and then move onto something more. We'll start by deploying [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) on our machine and then we'll install the CLI and write the handler for our function.

*OpenFaaS is democratising serverless functions - through Docker containers.*

**Pre-requisites:**

* [Docker CE 17.05](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) or later (for use on Swarm)
* Bash - if you're using Windows then install [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Brew](https://brew.sh) (optional)

> You can read my [Introduction to Functions as a Service](https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/) here.

### Step 1 - Install OpenFaaS

> If you already have FaaS and the CLI configured, skip to step 3.

Deploy OpenFaaS using one of [the Deployment guides](http://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/).

### Step 2 - Install the CLI

The CLI is a convenient way to interact with your functions. You can use it to build and/or deploy functions to your cluster.

On a Mac if you're using `brew` then you can type in:

```
$ brew install faas-cli
```

On Linux (or Mac without `brew` available) type in:

```
$ curl -sSL https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
```

> If you're using Windows, then you're not out of luck, you can actually find the Windows executable on the [FaaS releases page](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases).

### Step 3 - Write your function

Create a new folder for your work:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/functions && \
  cd ~/functions
```

Now let's scaffold a new Python function using the CLI:

```
$ faas-cli new --lang python hello-python
```

This creates three files for you:

```
hello-python/handler.py
hello-python/requirements.txt
hello-python.yml
```

Let's edit the handler.py file:

```
def handle(req):
    print("Hello! You said: " + req)
```

*handler.py*

All your functions should be specified in a YAML file like this - it tells the CLI what to build and deploy onto your OpenFaaS cluster.

Checkout the YAML file `hello-python.yml`:

```
provider:
  name: faas
  gateway: http://127.0.0.1:8080

functions:
  hello-python:
    lang: python
    handler: ./hello-python
    image: hello-python
```

*hello-python.yml*

* `gateway`- here we can specify a remote gateway if we need to, what the programming language is and where our handler is located within the filesystem.

* `functions` - this block defines the functions in our stack

* `lang: python` - even though Docker is used behind the scenes to package your function. You don't have to write your own Dockerfile unless you want to.

* `handler` - this is the folder / path to your handler.py file and any other source code you need

* `image` - this is the Docker image name. If you are going to push to the Docker Hub change the prefix from hello-python to include your Docker Hub account - i.e. alexellis/hello-python

So let's build the function.

```
$ faas-cli build -f ./hello-python.yml
...

Successfully tagged hello-python:latest
Image: hello-python built.
```

You'll now see output from the Docker Engine as it builds your function into an image in your local Docker library. You'll see the image appear on `docker images`

For example you could run:

```
$ docker images | grep hello-python
hello-python        latest       e0344b26305f     one minute ago
```

**Testing on a single host**

If you're trying this out on a single Docker Swarm cluster, then you don't need to push your images to a registry, they'll just be used from the local Docker library. If you're using Kubernetes and `minikube` and don't want to push to a remote container registry, then see the helm chart for how to set the `ImagePullPolicy`. This will enable use of images from the local library on Kubernetes.

**Remote host, or multi-node cluster**

If you are using a remote server or a multi-node cluster then you can push your function's image to a registry or the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com). The Docker Hub is a free service provided by Docker Inc for sharing container images over the Internet. 

> If you are an advanced user, you can also run a *container image registry* within your own network. Link: [Docker Registry docs](https://docs.docker.com/registry/)

You'll also need to image the `image:` name to include your Hub account such as `image: alexellis2/hello-python`.

Here's how to upload the function to a remote registry (if needed):

```
$ faas-cli push -f ./hello-python.yml
```

Once you have multiple functions you can also use the `--parallel` argument to speed things up.

Let's deploy the function:

```
$ faas-cli deploy -f ./hello-python.yml
Deploying: hello-python.
No existing service to remove
Deployed.
200 OK
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/function/hello-python
```

And it's ready to be tested! Either open up the UI or use `curl` to call it:

```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/function/hello-python -d "it's Alex here"
Hello! You said: its Alex here
```

You can even use the `faas-cli` to list and invoke your functions.

Try playing with these two commands including looking at the help page with the `--help` parameter:

* `faas-cli list`
* `echo "Hello!" | faas-cli invoke hello-python`

### Step 4 - Import 3rd party dependencies

So what if you need some dependencies to add behaviour beyond the standard Python libraries? Well you can use `pip` by providing a `requirements.txt` file along with your function handler.

Let's include the popular `requests` module which we can use to interact with webpages.

You will see a file called hello-python/requirements.txt. Add the following line:

```
requests
```
*requirements.txt*

Now we can update our Python code. Let's make it so it can accept JSON request of a URL and a string we want to test for:

We'll trigger it using a JSON request, which will take this format:

```
{
 "url": "https://blog.alexellis.io/rss/",
 "term": "docker"
}
```

Now update the `hello-python/handler.py` file:

```
import requests
import json

def handle(req):
    result = {"found": False}
    json_req = json.loads(req)
    r = requests.get(json_req["url"])
    if json_req["term"] in r.text:
        result = {"found": True}

    print json.dumps(result)
```
*handler.py*

Then just rebuild, (re-push if needed) and re-deploy.

```
$ faas-cli build -f ./hello-python.yml && \
  faas-cli deploy -f ./hello-python.yml
```
*This time you'll see `pip` installing your function's modules such as `requests`.

Finally test it out!

```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/function/hello-python --data-binary '{
 "url": "https://blog.alexellis.io/rss/",
 "term": "docker"
}'
```

Here's the result:

```
{"found": true}
```

Let's try another site:


```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/function/hello-python --data-binary '{
 "url": "https://www.kubernetes.io/",
 "term": "docker"
}'
{"found": False}
```

You can also access the function just as easily via the UI.

**Logging and troubleshooting**

* Docker Swarm

You can check the services deployed through the command:

```
$ docker service ls
```

Check a specific function like this:

```
docker service ps <function_name_here>
```

Find the logs for a function like this:

```
docker service logs <function_name_here>
```

> If your function has a lot of logs, then prefix this with `--tail 20`. Use `-f` if you want to stream them.

* Metrics

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is also baked into the FaaS stack, which means you can checkout the various metrics on how your functions are being used as well as how long they're taking to run. You can view the Prometheus UI at http://127.0.0.1:9090

* Troubleshooting

If you run into any errors you can follow our [troubleshooting guide](http://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/troubleshooting/) in the documentation

Here are two top tips:

* If it's a multi-node cluster, you have to push your images to the Docker Hub or similar registry before deploying
* If you're still getting the error `docker service logs --no-trunc=true hello-python` will give a bit more info.
