# Create new functions

## Get started

Once you've installed the `faas-cli` you can start creating and deploying functions via the `faas-cli up` command or using the individual commands:

* `faas-cli build` - build an image into the local Docker library
* `faas-cli push` - push that image to a remote container registry
* `faas-cli deploy` - deploy your function into a cluster

The `faas-cli up` command automates all of the above in a single command.

## Templates

The OpenFaaS CLI has a template engine built-in which can create new functions in a given programming language. The way this works is by reading a list of templates from the `./template` location in your current working folder.

Before creating a new function make sure you pull in the official OpenFaaS language templates from GitHub via the [templates repository](https://github.com/openfaas/templates).

```bash
$ faas-cli template pull
```

This page shows how to generate functions in the most popular languages and explains how you can manage their dependencies too.

### Classic vs. of-watchdog templates

The *Classic Templates* are held in the [openfaas/templates](https://github.com/openfaas/templates) repository and are based upon the *Classic Watchdog* which uses STDIO to communicate with your function. The of-watchdog uses HTTP to communicate with functions and most of its templates are available in the [openfaas-incubator](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/) organisation on GitHub and in the store.

How to pick:

* Use the *Classic Watchdog* if you're starting out or following tutorials or guides
* Use the *of-watchdog* if you need more performance or if you need full control of the HTTP response

See also: [watchdog design](/architecture/watchdog/)

### Template store

You can browse templates from the official store or create your own store and add your own templates there.

To see what templates are available type `faas-cli template store list` and you should see the following in the terminal:

```sh
$ faas-cli template store list

NAME                    SOURCE             DESCRIPTION
csharp                  openfaas           Official C# template
dockerfile              openfaas           Official Dockerfile template
go-armhf                openfaas           Official Golang armhf 
...
node10-express-armhf    openfaas-incubator NodeJS 10 Express armhf template
node10-express          openfaas-incubator NodeJS 10 Express template
ruby-http               openfaas-incubator Ruby 2.4 HTTP template
golang-middleware       openfaas-incubator Golang Middleware template
csharp-httprequest      distantcam         C# HTTP template
...
```

Choose a template and retrieve it locally with the command:

```sh
$ faas-cli template store pull node10-express
```  

Once downloaded, your chosen template and any others stored in the same repository will be available to use:

```sh
$ faas-cli new --list
Languages available as templates:
- node10-express
- node10-express-arm64
- node10-express-armhf
```

You can add your own store just by specifying the `--url` flag for both commands to pull and list your custom templates store.

### Classic Templates

The classic templates are held in the [openfaas/templates](https://github.com/openfaas/templates) repository.

#### 1.0 Go (classic template)

To create a new function named `go-fn` in Go type in the following:

```bash
$ faas-cli new go-fn --lang go
```

You will now see two files generate:

```
go-fn.yml
./go-fn/
./go-fn/handler.go
```

You can now edit `handler.go` and use the `faas-cli` to `build` and `deploy` your function.

##### 1.1 Go: dependencies

Dependencies should be managed with a Go vendoring tool such as dep.

* Get [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)

```
$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```

* Initialise the dependencies

```
$ $GOPATH/bin/dep init
```

* Now vendor a library

Make sure you're in the `go-fn` folder, now use `dep ensure -add` and the name of the library you want. In this example we are vendoring the `github.com/cnf/structhash` package for use in our function.

```
$ dep ensure -add github.com/cnf/structhash
```

* Reference the package from function

You can now edit your function and add an import statement in `handler.go` to `github.com/cnf/structhash`.

##### 1.2: Go with CGO

First you will need to add the `dev` build option:

```yaml
    build_options:
    - dev
```

This installs `gcc`, `make`, `git` and some other related packages for the build portion of the function's Dockerfile.

You can then enable CGO with a build-arg:

```
faas-cli build --build-arg CGO_ENABLED=1
```

#### 2.0 Python 3 (classic template)

To create a Python function named `pycon` type in:

```
$ faas-cli new pycon --lang python3
```

You'll see:

```
pycon.yml
pycon/handler.py
pycon/requirements.txt
```

> Note: Python 2.7 is also available with the language template `python`.

##### 2.1 Python: dependencies

You should edit `pycon/requirements.txt` and add any pip modules you want with each one on a new line, for instance `requests`.

The primary Python template uses Alpine Linux as a runtime environment due to its minimal size, but if you need a Debian environment so that you can compile `numpy` or other modules then read on to the next section.

##### 2.2 Python: advanced dependencies

If you need to use pip modules that require compilation then you should try the python3-debian template then add your pip modules to the `requirements.txt` file.

```
$ faas-cli template pull https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/python3-debian
$ faas-cli new numpy-function --lang python3-debian
$ echo "numpy" > ./numpy-function/requirements.txt
$ faas-build -f ./numpy-function.yml
...

Step 11/17 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
 ---> Running in d0ff430a607e

Installing collected packages: numpy
Successfully installed numpy-1.14.2

...
```

#### 3.0 Node.js (classic template)

Generate a function named `js-fn`:

```bash
$ faas-cli new js-fn --lang node
```

You'll see:

```bash
./js-fn.yml
./js-fn/
./js-fn/handler.js
./js-fn/package.json
```

##### 3.1 Node.js dependencies

Node.js dependencies are managed with `npm` and the `package.json` file which was generated for you.

To add the `cheerio` module type in:

```
cd js-fn
npm i --save cheerio
```

You can now add a `require('cheerio')` statement into your function and make use of this library.

#### 4.0 CSharp / .NET Core 2.1

You can create functions in .NET Core 2.1 using C# / CSharp.

* Write a function named csharp-function

```
faas-cli new --lang csharp csharp-function
```

Now you can open your current folder in a tool such as Visual Studio Code and add dependencies using the project (csproj) file.

#### 5.0 Ruby

Create a function called `ruby-function`:

```
$ faas-cli new --lang ruby ruby-function
```

The directory structure is:

```
├── ruby-function
│   ├── Gemfile
│   └── handler.rb
├── ruby-function.yml
```

Your code should be in the handler.rb file

##### 5.1 Adding a Gem (Library)

Open the `Gemfile` in the ruby-function directory

Add the following line

```
gem 'httparty'
```

##### 5.1 Using our Gem

Replace your `handler.rb` code with the following

```
require 'httparty'

class Handler
    def run(req)
        return HTTParty.get("http://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?site=stackoverflow&tagged=#{req}")
    end
end
```

##### 5.3 Building / Deploy / Run

Edit the `ruby-function.yml` and point your image to your dockerhub, for example
`${your_user}/ruby-function`

```
$ faas-cli up -f ruby-function.yml
...
Using bundler 1.16.4
Fetching multi_xml 0.6.0
Installing multi_xml 0.6.0
Fetching httparty 0.16.2
Installing httparty 0.16.2
Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 3 gems now installed.
Bundled gems are installed into `/usr/local/bundle`
Post-install message from httparty:
When you HTTParty, you must party hard!
...
```

Now you can invoke the function:

```
$ echo 'OpenFaaS' | faas-cli invoke ruby-function
{
   "quota_remaining" : 298,
   "quota_max" : 300,
   "has_more" : false,
   "items" : [
      {
         "title" : "Scaling with GPU usage",
         "creation_date" : 1536315498,
         "answer_count" : 0,
         "view_count" : 10,
         "is_answered" : false,
...
```


#### 6.0 Java

A Java 8 template is provided which uses Gradle 4.8.1 as a build-system.

Support is made available for external code repositories via the build.gradle file where you specify dependencies to fetch from repositories or JAR files to be added via the build.

* Write a function `java-function`:

```
$ faas-cli new --lang java8 java-function
```

* Write your code in:

./src/main/Handler.java

* Write `junit` tests in:

./src/tests/

* Update gradle config if needed in:

./build.gradle
./settings.gradle

* Working with headers

You can use `getHeader(k)` on the Request interface to query a header.

To set a header such as content-type you can use `setHeader(k, v)` on the Response interface.

#### 7.0 PHP 7

To create a PHP7 function named `my-function` type in:

    $ faas-cli new my-function --lang php7

You'll see:

    my-function.yml
    my-function/src/Handler.php
    my-function/composer.json
    my-function/php-extension.sh

Add any dependencies/extensions as described below and implement your functions business logic in `Handler.php`.

#### 7.1 Composer Dependencies

You should edit `composer.json` and add any required package dependencies, referring to the [Composer Documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) for instructions on using `composer.json`.

##### 7.2 Private Composer Repositories

Refer to the [PHP7 Template Documentation](https://github.com/openfaas/templates/tree/master/template/php7) for instructions on how to use [Composers](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) `COMPOSER_AUTH` environment variable to configure access to dependencies in private repositories.

##### 7.3 PHP Extensions

The PHP7 template is based upon the [Docker Library PHP image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) and provides the `php-extension.sh` script which exposes the ability to customise extensions installed in a function image.

Refer to the [PHP7 Template Documentation](https://github.com/openfaas/templates/tree/master/template/php7) for instructions on customising installed extensions.

#### 8.0 Customise a template

It is recommended that you use the official templates as they are provided and if there is a short-coming that you raise a GitHub issue so we can improve the templates for everyone.

All templates are driven by a Dockerfile and can be customised by editing the files found in the ./template folder.

##### 8.1 Update the Dockerfile

There are several reasons why you may want to update your Dockerfile, just edit `./template/<language_name>/Dockerfile`.

* New base image - some companies prefer to use their own base images for Docker images for compliance, support or licensing reasons

* Add native package - sometimes you may want to add a native package from the Alpine Linux repository or the Debian package repository - just add a step into the Dockerfile

* Try a new version of a base-image - it may be that the project is showing support for Node.js LTS, but you want the cutting-edge version, you can do that too

##### 8.2 Update a template's configuration

The name of a template is read from a "template.yml" file kept within the template folder: `./template/<language_name>/template.yml`

For `csharp` we have the following:

```
language: csharp
fprocess: dotnet ./root.dll
```

* `language` is the display name used for `faas-cli new --list`.
* `fprocess` provides the process to run for each invocation - i.e. your function

##### 8.3 Use your own templates

You can use your own Git repository for a custom or forked set of templates. This can be public or private.

See `faas-cli template pull` for more information.

If you want to set up your own default template location, specify the `OPENFAAS_TEMPLATE_URL` environmental variable the following way:

```bash
export OPENFAAS_TEMPLATE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/mytemplate/customtemplates
```

##### 8.4 Download templates from the template store

> Note: In order to access the template store you need `0.8.1` version of the CLI or higher

Check what templates are available in the template store with the CLI by typing:

```bash
faas-cli template store list
```

Pull the desired template by specifying `NAME` attribute only:

```bash
faas-cli template store pull go
```

or pull the template by mixing the `REPOSITORY` and `NAME` attributes the following way:

```bash
faas-cli template store pull openfaas/go
```

To get more information on specific store use the `describe` verb like:

```bash
faas-cli template store describe openfaas/go
```

or if there is no collision between names use only the name field:

```bash
faas-cli template store describe go
```

If you have your own store with templates, you can set that as your default official store by setting the environmental variable `OPENFAAS_TEMPLATE_STORE_URL` the following way:

```bash
export OPENFAAS_TEMPLATE_STORE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/openfaas-templates/templates.json
```

Now the source of the store is changed to the URL you have specified above.

## ARM / Raspberry Pi

Templates for ARM and Raspberry Pi are provided on a best-effort basis. If you can help with maintenance please let the project contributors know.

* ARMv7 / Raspberry Pi

Type in `faas-cli new --list` and look for any languages ending in `-armhf`. You can use any of these for your functions.

* ARM64 / Packet.net / Scaleway ARM 64-bit

For these platforms do the same as above and look for the `-arm64` suffix.

> It is easy to make your own templates so if you need to use this platform please convert one of the "regular" templates for your platform.
