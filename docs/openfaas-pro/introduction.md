## OpenFaaS Pro

OpenFaaS Pro is a commercially licensed distribution of OpenFaaS with additional features, configurations and commercial support from the founders. 

!!! info "Do we need the Community Edition or Pro?"

    OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) is meant for open-source developers and basic exploration, OpenFaaS Pro is meant for production.

### Core platform

Efficiency and redundancy:

* [New auto-scaling engine](/architecture/autoscaling/) to get the scaling just right either on Requests Per Second (RPS), Inflight requests or CPU.
* [Scale idle functions to zero](/openfaas-pro/scale-to-zero) to save on compute costs, increase efficiency and lower your threat profile
* [Retry failed invocations for functions](/openfaas-pro/retries) to handle issues with downstream APIs and back-pressure on concurrency-limited functions
* CPU and RAM usage metrics for every function to measure usage and fine-tune limits

> Scaling that works for various types of functions

The OpenFaaS Pro autoscaler emits detailed usage information, meaning functions can scale not just on requests per second, but inflight requests and CPU utilisation.

Usability and operations:

[![The OpenFaaS dashboard](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPKw2VUWYA4pzV7?format=jpg&name=medium)](/openfaas-pro/dashboard/)

The OpenFaaS dashboard integrates with CPU & RAM usage metrics, and container logs to give you insights on your functions in one place. You can also add metadata from your source control management tool like a SHA, owner, project or URL to the source code.

* [OpenFaaS Dashboard](/openfaas-pro/dashboard/)

### Events and triggers

Event-driven programming and triggers:

* [Trigger functions via Kafka](/openfaas-pro/kafka-events) for event-driven functions and to integrate with your existing systems
* [Trigger functions from AWS SQS](/openfaas-pro/sqs-events) to integrate with events from AWS.

### Workload tuning

To avoid errors when scaling up or down, you may need to tune your function's configuration to suit how it works. Pro users get access to fine-tune health checks, set custom Kubernetes service accounts and termination grace periods for shutting down functions.

* Custom HTTP health checks for functions - including path, period seconds and initial delay
* Custom Kubernetes service accounts for functions to access the Kubernetes API
* Custom runtime profiles for security & isolation using gVisor, kata containers etc.
* Custom TerminationGracePeriod for draining work for long running functions
* Custom support for probing Istio endpoints during scale from zero

### Enterprise security

* [Single Sign-On using OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/openfaas-pro/sso) means each user authenticates with their own identity, instead of sharing one set of credentials, which is insecure. Use your existing OIDC-compatible Identity Provider (IdP).

### Platform building features

Build functions at scale - for services providers and large teams:

* [Build functions via REST API](/openfaas-pro/builder) using source code without the need to create and manage dozens or hundreds of independent CI jobs.

### On our roadmap

Recently released:

* Scaling upon inflight requests for long running & memory/CPU bound functions (released Jan 2022)
* A new Pro UI dashboard for managing and monitoring OpenFaaS functions across namespaces (released March 2022)
* CPU and RAM usage metrics within the OpenFaaS API, CLI and Pro UI dashboard (released Feb 2022)
* AWS SQS event-connector (released January 2022)
* Concurrency limiting for functions - i.e. one request per container
* Redesigned async system with NATS JetStream which replaces NATS Streaming (available in pilot)
    * NATS Streaming is available for CE and will be deprecated in June 2023.
    * Dedicated Helm chart for installing additional queue-workers with JetStream
    * Structured logging / JSON for OpenFaaS Pro customers in the queue-worker
* Postgres event connector using either WAL or LISTEN/NOTIFY

Upcoming:

* Enhanced RBAC for functions and the OpenFaaS REST API
* AMQP event trigger for RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus
* Enhanced multi-tenant isolation for large organisations and service providers

### Comparison

!!! info "Do we need the Community Edition or Pro?"

    OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) is meant for open-source developers and initial exploration of functions, OpenFaaS Pro is meant for production.

OpenFaaS Pro is a distribution of OpenFaaS with additional features and configurations that we believe customers need to operate a product or service in production.

As we tune OpenFaaS Pro for our existing customers, we improve it for everyone else at the same time - writing articles, tuning configuration and adding key features.

We see it as the start of a two-way relationship and an opportunity to collaborate directly with our team.

Any user of OpenFaaS is welcome to attend [a weekly Office Hours call](/community), which is a shared space for collaboration.

**Autoscaling**

Did you know? OpenFaaS Pro's autoscaling engine can scale many different types of functions and closely match the load with the right amount of replicas.

| Description           | OpenFaaS CE       | OpenFaaS Pro           | OpenFaaS Enterprise             |
| ----------------------| ------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Scale to Zero | Not supported | [Global default, or custom time per function](/openfaas-pro/scale-to-zero) | As per Pro |
| Scale to From | Not supported | Supported, with additional checks for Istio | As per Pro |

| Autoscaling granularity   | Single rule for all functions | Global defaults with override available per function      | As per Pro |

Data-driven, intensive, or long running functions are best suited to capacity-based autoscaling, which is available in OpenFaaS Pro.

Scaling to zero is also a Pro feature, which can be customised on a function-level.

| Split installation without ClusterAdmin role | N/a | Provided in [Customer Community](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-pro) | As per Pro | 

Isolation using Kata containers or gVisor is advisable when running untrusted code, or when you want to ensure that your functions are not vulnerable to container escape attacks.

**Platform features**

We have several customers of varying size who host code on behalf of their customers. OpenFaaS can provide a complete workflow from building the code securely, to deploying it within an isolated namespace. It's easy to integrate with existing systems using the REST APIs we make available.

| Description           | OpenFaaS CE       | OpenFaaS Pro           | OpenFaaS Enterprise             |
| ----------------------| ------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Deploy functions via REST API | Yes | As per CE | As per CE | 
| Build containers and functions via REST API | N/a | N/a | [Yes via Function Builder API](/openfaas-pro/builder) |
| Multiple namespace support | No support | N/a | Supported with Kubernetes namespaces |

Some customers extend their own platform using OpenFaaS functions, because it's quicker and easier to deploy a function than change the core platform.

### Support

OpenFaaS Enterprise comes with support for the Certified Open Source Components and OpenFaaS Pro, with support via email within a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Along with email support, each team gets their own dedicated Slack channel for questions, collaboration and assistance.

OpenFaaS Pro operates on a self-service model with support for OpenFaaS Pro features only via email.

Both tiers come with access to the [Customer Community](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-pro), for feedback & collaboration with the OpenFaaS developers and other customers. 

No support is offered to commercial users of OpenFaaS CE, which is primarily meant for exploration and open source developers.

### Getting started

OpenFaaS Pro is developed primarily for team deploying to Kubernetes, however most of the features are also compatible with faasd. Learn about faasd and OpenFaaS Pro here: [The Event-Driven Edge with OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/eventdriven-edge/)
