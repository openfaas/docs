## OpenFaaS Pro

OpenFaaS Pro is a commercially licensed distribution of OpenFaaS with additional features, configurations and commercial support from the founders.

There are two editions of OpenFaaS Pro - Standard and for Enterprises.

Standard is meant for any team making use of OpenFaaS at work, whether external, or internal-facing. OpenFaaS for Enterprises is meant for multi-tenancy, and regulated companies who have additional requirements around security, compliance and support.

!!! info "Do we need the Community Edition or Pro?"

    OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) is meant for open-source developers and basic exploration, OpenFaaS Pro is meant for production.

### Core platform

Efficiency and redundancy:

* [New auto-scaling engine](/architecture/autoscaling/) to get the scaling just right either on Requests Per Second (RPS), Inflight requests or CPU.
* [Scale idle functions to zero](/openfaas-pro/scale-to-zero) to save on compute costs, increase efficiency and lower your threat profile
* [Retry failed invocations for functions](/openfaas-pro/retries) to handle issues with downstream APIs and back-pressure on concurrency-limited functions
* CPU and RAM usage metrics for every function to measure usage and fine-tune limits
* GitOps compatibility with the Function CustomResource, with Helm, ArgoCD and FluxCD.

> Scaling that works for various types of functions

The OpenFaaS Pro autoscaler emits detailed usage information, meaning functions can scale not just on requests per second, but inflight requests and CPU utilisation.

Usability and operations:

[![The OpenFaaS dashboard](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPKw2VUWYA4pzV7?format=jpg&name=medium)](/openfaas-pro/dashboard/)

The OpenFaaS dashboard integrates with CPU & RAM usage metrics, and container logs to give you insights on your functions in one place. You can also add metadata from your source control management tool like a SHA, owner, project or URL to the source code.

* [OpenFaaS Dashboard](/openfaas-pro/dashboard/)

### Events and triggers

Event-driven programming and triggers:

* [Trigger functions via Kafka](/openfaas-pro/kafka-events) for event-driven functions and to integrate with your existing systems
* [Trigger functions from AWS SQS](/openfaas-pro/sqs-events) to integrate with events from AWS.

### Workload tuning

To avoid errors when scaling up or down, you may need to tune your function's configuration to suit how it works. Pro users get access to fine-tune health checks, set custom Kubernetes service accounts and termination grace periods for shutting down functions.

* Custom HTTP health checks for functions - including path, period seconds and initial delay
* Custom Kubernetes service accounts for functions to access the Kubernetes API
* Custom runtime profiles for security & isolation using gVisor, kata containers etc.
* Custom TerminationGracePeriod for draining work for long running functions
* Custom support for probing Istio endpoints during scale from zero

### Enterprise security

* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Single Sign On with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

[Learn more about IAM for OpenFaaS](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-pro/iam/overview/)

### Platform building features

Run a secure, multi-tenant functions platform - for internal or external users:

* [Build a Multi-Tenant Functions Platform with OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/build-a-multi-tenant-functions-platform/)

Build functions at scale - for services providers and large teams:

* [Build functions via REST API](/openfaas-pro/builder) using source code without the need to create and manage dozens or hundreds of independent CI jobs.

Integrate securely using short-lived tokens from your Identity Provider (IdP) or from Kubernetes:

* [How to authenticate to the OpenFaaS API using Kubernetes JWT tokens](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/kubernetes-tokens-openfaas-api/)

### Grafana dashboards

OpenFaaS comes with [built-in Prometheus metrics](/architecture/metrics). We provide [a collection of Grafana dashboards](/openfaas-pro/grafana-dashboards) to customers to help with monitoring OpenFaaS and individual functions.

### Private code from functions

Get access to Pro plugins for the faas-cli and additional function templates to build functions that require code from private Git, PyPy or NPM.

* Use private npm, python, go modules from functions with [faas-cli plugins and build-time secrets](/cli/build/#plugins-and-build-time-secrets)

### On our roadmap

### Comparison

!!! info "Do we need the Community Edition or Pro?"

    OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) is meant for open-source developers and initial exploration of functions, OpenFaaS Pro is meant for production.

OpenFaaS Pro is a distribution of OpenFaaS with additional features and configurations that we believe customers need to operate a product or service in production.

As we tune OpenFaaS Pro for our existing customers, we improve it for everyone else at the same time - writing articles, tuning configuration and adding key features.

We see it as the start of a two-way relationship and an opportunity to collaborate directly with our team.

OpenFaaS For Enterprise comes with an SLA, defined separately. It is suitable for companies which have a separate legal and procurement department, who are regulated and have additional legal or compliance requirements. The annual architecture review is to reduce risk by reviewing the configuration and informing the team of any recommended changes to the installation and configuration of OpenFaaS.

Support for OpenFaaS Pro is on a self-service basis, with no formal SLA offered. That said, our our customers say good things about the help and insights we've given them.

The [Customer Community](https://github.com/openfaas/customers) is a private GitHub repository for giving feedback to the OpenFaaS team, for early access to new features and collaboration with other customers.

The OpenFaaS community holds a weekly [Office Hours call](/community) on Zoom where you can start contributing to the project and ask any additional questions you may have.

**Autoscaling**

Did you know? OpenFaaS Pro's autoscaling engine can scale many different types of functions and closely match the load with the right amount of replicas.

| Description           | OpenFaaS CE       | OpenFaaS Standard           | OpenFaaS for Enterprise             |
| ----------------------| ------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Scale to Zero | Not supported | [Global default, or custom time per function](/openfaas-pro/scale-to-zero) | As per Pro |
| Maximum replicas per function | 5 Pods | No limit applied | As per Pro |
| Scale from Zero | Not supported | Supported, with additional checks for Istio | As per Pro |
| Autoscaling strategy   | RPS-only | [CPU utilization, Capacity (inflight requests) or RPS](/architecture/autoscaling)      | As per Pro |
| Autoscaling granularity   | Single rule for all functions | Configurable per function | As per Pro |

Data-driven, intensive, or long running functions are best suited to capacity-based autoscaling, which is only available in OpenFaaS Pro.

Scaling to zero is also a Pro feature, which can be opted into on a per function basis, with a custom idle threshold.

Isolation using Kata containers or gVisor is advisable when running untrusted code, or when you want to ensure that your functions are not vulnerable to container escape attacks.

**Platform features**

We have several customers of varying size who host code on behalf of their customers. OpenFaaS can provide a complete workflow from building the code securely, to deploying it within an isolated namespace. It's easy to integrate with existing systems using the REST APIs we make available.

| Description           | OpenFaaS CE       | OpenFaaS Standard           | OpenFaaS for Enterprise             |
| ----------------------| ------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Deploy functions via REST API | Yes | As per CE | As per CE | 
| Manage namespaces via REST API | N/a | N/a | Full CRUD API available |
| Build containers and functions via REST API | N/a | N/a | [Yes via Function Builder API](/openfaas-pro/builder) |
| Multiple namespace support | No support | N/a | Supported with Kubernetes namespaces |
