# OpenFaaS Dashboard

The OpenFaaS Dashboard is a new UI, rebuilt to make operating and understanding OpenFaaS easier.

> Note: This feature is included for [OpenFaaS Standard & For Enterprises](https://openfaas.com/pricing/) customers.


## Using the dashboard

Your browser can save the password for your various OpenFaaS environments, so that the credentials can follow you between machines, or be saved in password manager like 1Password.

Once logged in, you'll be met by the namespace selector. Namespaces can be used to group functions together, or to provide a level of isolation between teams using the same OpenFaaS installation.

> An overview of functions

Note that the fields such as repository and SHA can be populated at deploy time and integrate into the UI to create links and show you what's deployed.

![The details for a function](/images/dashboard/details.png)

> View the details for a function, including metrics, logs and metadata about its deployment

![View logs without a terminal, in one place](/images/dashboard/logs.png)

> The logs of the figlet function, viewed without `kubectl` or needing separate terminal access.

```bash
faas-cli store deploy \
    figlet \
    --gateway https://of-pro.example.com \
    --env write_debug=true \
    --env read_debug=true
for i in {0..3}; do curl https://of-pro.example.com/function/figlet -d $i ; done
```

To populate the metadata in the UI, simply set the following at deployment time via `faas-cli deploy` or the OpenFaaS Custom Resource:
 
| Type | Key | Example value |
|------|-----|---------------|
| label | `com.openfaas.git-branch` | `master` |
| label | `com.openfaas.git-owner` | `openfaas` |
| annotation | `com.openfaas.git-repo-url` | `https://github.com/openfaas/store-functions` |
| label | `com.openfaas.git-repo` | `store-functions` |
| label | `com.openfaas.git-sha` | `665d9597547d8e0425630ba2dbb73c2951a61ce2` |

Here's an example:

```bash
faas-cli store deploy cows \
  --label com.openfaas.scale.min=2 \
  --annotation com.openfaas.git-repo-url=https://github.com/openfaas/store-functions \
  --label com.openfaas.git-owner=openfaas \
  --label com.openfaas.git-repo=store-functions \
  --label com.openfaas.git-branch=master \
  --label com.openfaas.git-sha=f79e2c86e8d67f747d1e449ba6ca63eb5858e5bb
```

Any of these fields can be replaced through environment substitution in stack.yml or using helm during CI/CD.

Example snippet from stack.yml:

```yaml
functions:
  cows:
    lang: go
    handler: ./cows
    image: alexellis2/cows:0.1
    labels:
      com.openfaas.git-sha: ${GIT_SHA:-dev}
```

Then using environment variables from your CI system such as GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, override any variables you want to change.

Example of injecting the SHA from Gitlab:

```bash
GIT_SHA=$CI_COMMIT_SHA faas-cli deploy
```

Example with GitHub Actions:

```bash
GIT_SHA=$GITHUB_SHA faas-cli deploy
```

When the GIT_SHA variable is omitted, then the text `dev` will be inputted instead.

## Installation

The OpenFaaS Dashboard is installed through the [openfaas helm chart](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/tree/master/chart/openfaas), and will also work with faasd.

Before deploying, you'll need to have created a secret for your license, you'll find instruction in the helm chart for this.

### Create a signing key

You need to create a JWT signing key and a separate secret for the dashboard. It's used to sign and validate logged in sessions.

```bash
# Generate a private key
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out jwt_key

# Then create a public key from the private key
openssl ec -in jwt_key -pubout -out jwt_key.pub

# Store both in a secret in the openfaas namespace
kubectl -n openfaas \
  create secret generic dashboard-jwt \
  --from-file=key=./jwt_key \
  --from-file=key.pub=./jwt_key.pub
```

!!! note

    For easy deployment during development this step can be skipped. The dashboard will automatically create the required signing keys on startup.

    Note that these keys will be recreated any time the dashboard container is restarted invalidating any logged in sessions.

### Configure the dashboard

To enable the dashboard feature, add the following to your values.yaml file for the openfaas chart:

```yaml
dashboard:
  enabled: true
  publicURL: https://dashboard.example.com
  # Name of signing key secret for sessions.
  # Can be left blank for development deployments.
  signingKeySecret: "dashboard-jwt" 
```

The `publicURL`, doesn't necessarily have to be publicly exposed on the Internet, but it does need to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

The `signingKeySecret` can be left blank to auto generate signing keys (See: [Create a signing key](#create-a-signing-key)).

### Configure the dashboard with IAM

If you have enabled [Identity and Access Management (IAM) for OpenFaaS](/openfaas-pro/iam/overview/) authentication to the dashboard happens via OpenID Connect(OIDC). This requires a few extra configuration steps.

1. Configure an OIDC provider.
    
    If you have already configured your OIDC provider and registered it with OpenFaaS this step can be skipped. If you did not configure any providers see: [Single Sign-On (SSO) for the OpenFaaS CLI and dashboard](/openfaas-pro/sso/overview/)

2. Generate AES encryption key

    An AES encryption key needs to be generated and stored in secret in the openfaas namespace. This AES key is used to encrypt the OpenFaaS access token.

    ```bash
    # Generate a key
    openssl rand -hex 16 > aes_key

    # Store the key in a secret in the openfaas namespace
    kubectl -n openfaas \
      create secret generic aes-key \
      --from-file=aes_key=./aes_key
    ```

3. Create a Kubernetes secret for the OAuth client secret
    
    This step can be skipped if the issuer used for the dashboard does not need a client secret. Retrieve the client secret from your identity provider and store it a file `client_secret`. 

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic \
      -n openfaas \
      oauth-client-secret \
      --from-file client_secret=./client_secret
    ```

4. Configure the OpenFaaS deployment

    Add the following to `iam` section in your values.yaml file for the openfaas chart:

    ```yaml
    iam:
      dashboardIssuer:
        # URL if the issuer
        url: "https://example.auth0.com"
        clientId: ""
        # Name of Kubernetes secret containing the client secret.
        # Can be left blank if a client secret is not required e.g for the PKCE flow.
        clientSecret: "oauth-client-secret"
        scopes:
          - openid
          - profile
          - email
    ```

    The clientSecret can be left blank if your OIDC provider does not require a secret.

    Depending on your provider and setup you might need to request additional scopes. These can be set through the `scopes` parameter.

### Access your dashboard via port-forwarding

If you don't want to expose your dashboard to users over the Internet, then you can access it as and when required using port-forwarding. Instead of giving a domain and DNS record, you can set the public url in your values.yaml file to `localhost` or an empty string.

```yaml
dashboard:
  enabled: true
  publicURL: "localhost"
```

To access the dashboard run the following, whenever you need it:

```bash
kubectl port-forward \
  -n openfaas \
  svc/dashboard 8081:8080
```

The username is `admin` and the password is the same one used for `faas-cli login`.

Then access the URL via `http://127.0.0.1:8081`

### Expose your dashboard on the Internet

Once deployed, you can leave your dashboard private, and access it via port-forwarding, or create a Public Ingress record to access it over the Internet.

There two three options for Public Ingress:

* Kubernetes Ingress Controller
* Istio Gateway/VirtualService.

If your cluster does not have a public IP, but you still want to access the dashboard over the Internet, we have included notes on how [inlets.dev](https://inlets.dev) can help.

Assuming you already have a Let's Encrypt Issuer and are using ingress-nginx, you could use the following example:

```bash
export DOMAIN="openfaas.example.com"
export INGRESS_CLASS=nginx

cat > ingress.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: openfaas-dashboard
  namespace: openfaas
  labels:
    app: openfaas-dashboard
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    $INGRESS_CLASS.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: $INGRESS_CLASS
spec:
  rules:
  - host: $DOMAIN
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: dashboard
            port:
              number: 8080
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - $DOMAIN
    secretName: dashboard-cert
EOF
```

TLS is mandatory, and you'll use your OpenFaaS password to log in with your browser.

A much simpler alternative for local testing and development is to set up an inlets VM in HTTPS mode: [inlets automated HTTP server](https://docs.inlets.dev/tutorial/automated-http-server/).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: inlets-dashboard-client
  namespace: openfaas
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: inlets-dashboard-client
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: inlets-dashboard-client
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: inlets-dashboard-client
        image: ghcr.io/inlets/inlets-pro:0.9.3
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        command: ["inlets-pro"]
        args:
        - "http"
        - "client"
        - "--url=wss://EXIT_SERVER_IP"
        - "--token="
        - "--license="
        - "--upstream=dashboard.example.com=http://dashboard.openfaas:8080"
        - "--upstream=gateway.example.com=http://gateway.openfaas:8080"
```

You can use the same tunnel and exit server for multiple domains, to expose both the gateway and the dashboard with TLS and authentication.
