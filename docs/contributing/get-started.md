## Contribute to the project

There are many ways to contribute to the OpenFaaS project.

Before raising a PR or an issue request that you read our [Contributing guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) which applies to every OpenFaaS GitHub repository. We have a wide range of suggestions for contributing to the project and community and only some of those involve writing code.

### Five practical ideas for a first contribution

* Try the [workshop](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop)

* Read the [architecture diagrams](https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/gateway/)

* Submit a function to the [Function Store](https://github.com/openfaas/store)

* Write a blog post and add it to our [community listing](https://docs.openfaas.com/community/#community-resources)

* Improve the [OpenFaaS CLI tooling](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) with a PR or documentation

### Main Git repositories

Git is used for version control and all repositories are public available under two organisations.

#### OpenFaaS

OpenFaaS started as a single mono-repo called `faas` and has been broken out into separate repositories. For this reason you should always collate Issues, PRs, contributor counts, stars and similar statistics from the organisation as a whole. The data in the `faas` repo is not representive of the whole project.

| Repository        | Headline                         |

#### OpenFaaS-Incubator

The incubator organisation is for experiments, research and for getting quick feedback. Only some of the projects incubated here will make it into the main project.
