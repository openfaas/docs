## Contribute to the project

There are many ways to contribute to OpenFaaS and a wide variety of activities that help both the project and the community.

Before raising a PR or an Issue, it is requested that you read the project's [Contributing guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). This guide applies to every OpenFaaS GitHub repository. We have a wide range of suggestions for contributing to the project and community and only some of those involve writing code.

Examples may be: writing some Go code, reviewing a PR, helping with the website or UI, volunteering to write documentation for a new feature, creating code examples, or something else completely.

### Five practical ideas to get started

* Try the [workshop](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop)

* Read the [architecture diagrams](https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/gateway/)

* Submit a function to the [Function Store](https://github.com/openfaas/store)

* Write a blog post and add it to the [community file](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/community.md)

* Improve the [OpenFaaS CLI tooling](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) with a PR or documentation

#### Communicate with the community

Let the project team know in the #contributors channel on Slack.

* Decide how many hours you think you may be able to contribute
* Think about where you are most comfortable starting out and what you would like to work on
* Ask for help if you don't know where to begin

### Main source repositories

All source is organised under two repositories on GitHub: openfaas and openfaas-incubator. Some prototyping may take place under the personal accounts of the [Members Team](https://github.com/orgs/openfaas/people).  Please refer to the [Main Repositories](./contributing/main-repositories.md/) page for full details.
