## Project source repositories

All source is organised under two repositories on GitHub: openfaas and openfaas-incubator. Some prototyping may take place under the personal accounts of the [Members Team](https://github.com/orgs/openfaas/people).

### OpenFaaS org

OpenFaaS started as a single mono-repo called `faas` and has been broken out into separate repositories in the [openfaas](https://github.com/openfaas/) organisation.

For this reason you should always collate statistics from the `openfaas` organisation, rather than the repository of a single component, which would provide invalid data. So whether counting issues, PRs, contributors, stars, or any other metric, use the whole organisation.

### OpenFaaS Incubator

The [openfaas-incubator organisation](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/) contains projects which are under active development.

Some people wrongly assume that the "incubator" organisation means that these projects have a special status, or that they are unsuitable for production. Projects that are unsuitable for production usage will say so in their readme file.
