# Deployment

!!! warning "A foreword on security"
    These instructions are for a development environment. If you plan to expose OpenFaaS on the public Internet you need to enable basic authentication with a proxy such as Kong or Traefik at a minimum. TLS is also highly recomended and freely available with LetsEncrypt.org.

    [Kong guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/guide/kong_integration.md) 

    [Traefik guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/guide/traefik_integration.md)


## Kubernetes

OpenFaaS is Kubernetes native and you can follow the [deployment guide here](/deployment/kubernetes/).

## Docker Swarm

You can follow the [deployment guide for Docker Swarm](/deployment/swarm/) or use the Docker Playground below if you don't have direct access to Docker.

### Docker Playground

You can quickly start OpenFaaS on Docker Swarm online using the community-run Docker playground: play-with-docker.com (PWD) by clicking the button below:
