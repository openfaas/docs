## Secrets with OpenFaaS Cloud

There are two ways to bind to [OpenFaaS secrets](/reference/secrets) with OpenFaaS Cloud which apply when self-hosted.

### Encrypt a secret for use in your git repository

You can encrypt or *seal* secrets so that they can be committed to your git repository. Each secret can be sealed using the public key of the cluster which you can get from your administrator.

OpenFaaS Cloud uses [SealedSecrets by Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) for encrypting or sealing your confidential information.

#### Pre-reqs:

* If you installed OpenFaaS Cloud using `ofc-bootstrap` then SealedSecrets will already be installed and available

* If you installed OpenFaaS Cloud manually, you can add it with the [development guide](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud/tree/master/docs#sealedsecret-support)

* Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli#openfaas-cloud-extensions) to install the dependency `kubeseal`

* Export the public key of your cluster

* If you are using the Community Cluster, then use this link: [pub-cert.pem](https://github.com/openfaas/cloud-functions/blob/master/pub-cert.pem).

#### Walk-through

* Create a new git repository under your account `username`
* Create a new function i.e. `faas new --lang go has-secret --prefix=username`
* Copy `pub-cert.pem` into the root of the repository
* Run `faas-cli cloud seal`, this will create `secrets.yml`.

For information on the flags available see the [faas-cli docs](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli#openfaas-cloud-extensions)

When sealing secrets we specify a unique `--name` for the set of secrets, this should always be prefixed with your username or organisation name, using only lower case characters. Then enter a number of `--literal` and/or `--from-file` flags which correspond to each secret in the set.

So if we wanted to seal a single secret called `api-key` with a value of `test1234` we could run:

```sh
faas-cli cloud seal --name username-my-secrets \
  --literal api-key=test1234
```

Your function will access the secret via:

* `/var/openfaas/secrets/api-key`

If you have more than one secret you can enter additional `--literal` flags:

```sh
faas-cli cloud seal --name username-my-secrets \
  --literal api-key=test1234 \
  --literal hostname=myhost.com
```

Your function will access the secret via:

* `/var/openfaas/secrets/api-key`
* `/var/openfaas/secrets/hostname`

You can also read in an entire file:

```sh
faas-cli cloud seal --name username-my-secrets \
  --from-file=private-key.pem
```

Your function will access the secret via:

* `/var/openfaas/secrets/private-key.pem`

* Edit `stack.yml`

Add the secret to the `secrets:` section of your YAML, use the value from `--name`, but remove the username prefix.

```yaml
provider:
  name: openfaas
  gateway: http://127.0.0.1:8080

functions:
  has-secret:
    lang: go
    handler: ./has-secret
    image: alexellis/has-secret
    secrets:
      - my-secrets
```
*stack.yml*

* Now run `git push`

Check the git commit status in the repo, or view your overview page at: `https://system.example.com`

#### `faas-cli cloud seal` reference

| Flag              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| --name            | The name of the secret object prefixed with your GitHub username |
| --cert            | pub-cert.pem from the Community Cluster, or your local cluster |
| --literal         | Secret key and value pair. You can specify this parameter more than once to add more secrets |
| --from-file       | Read secret from file. **Note** secret key name will be the filename |

##### Example [from reference repository](https://github.com/alexellis/my-fn):

We'll encrypt an incoming webhook URL for Slack, which should be considered as confidential information.

Let's write the example function:

```yaml
def handle(req):
    webhook_url = None
    with open("/var/openfaas/secrets/incoming-webhook-url") as webhook_url_text:
        webhook_url = webhook_url_text.read().strip()

    respond_to_user(req, webhook_url)
```
*handler.py*

We see that the secret is read as per any other OpenFaaS secret, from the mounted location on disk at: `/var/openfaas/secrets/`.

Now let's look at how we seal the secret:

```sh
# Seal secrets for owner alexellis named `fn-secrets`

faas-cli cloud seal --name alexellis-fn-secrets \
  --literal incoming-webhook-url=https://...
```

Here's the file generated by the command above:

```yaml
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: alexellis-fn-secrets
  namespace: openfaas-fn
spec:
  encryptedData:
    incoming-webhook-url: (redacted)
```
*secrets.yaml*

And finally, we now need to reference the name of our secret in `stack.yml`. Notice that the key and the secret name do not have to match, this is because we can have multiple secret key/values within a single secret.

```yaml
provider:
  name: openfaas
  gateway: http://127.0.0.1:8080

functions:
  slack-me:
    lang: python
    handler: ./slack-me
    image: alexellis/slack-me
    secrets:
      - fn-secrets
```
*stack.yml*

#### Troubleshooting

The steps above must be followed precisely and if you have mis-read any of the details this may result in the secret not being accessible.

Notes:

* When using `faas-cli cloud seal` your secret set name needs to be prefixed with your username i.e. `alexellis-my-secret`
* In `stack.yml` your secrets should have no prefix, this is added later automatically
* The key from `--literal` or `--from-file` will be mounted under `/var/openfaas/secrets/` and can be read from there
* You must commit `secrets.yaml` into the root of your repository and do a `git push`

If in doubt check your results against [this reference repository](https://github.com/openfaas/cloud-functions).

### Create secrets manually (not recommended)

You can create secrets manually via `faas-cli secret create` or by using `kubectl`. These secrets will be available to users if the prefix of the secret matches the owner of the code being deployed, i.e.

If you are using an organization or repo named `myorg` and want a secret named `api-key` you could run:

```sh
$ faas-cli secret create myorg-api-key
```

In your `stack.yml` file in the `secrets` section, you could then reference the `api-key` secret.

This method relies on you having administrative access or making a request to your administrator.
