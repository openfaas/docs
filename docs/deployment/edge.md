## OpenFaaS Edge

OpenFaaS Edge (aka faasd-pro) is the commercial distribution of our faasd project.

faasd takes the core OpenFaaS components, and packages them for use on a single host, without the cost and complexity of Kubernetes. It is distributed as a single binary, and runs as a systemd service. It can manage both functions, and a set of stateful services such as databases, messages brokers, monitoring tools, and custom agents.

Kubernetes can be a complex system to install and manage, needing many add-on components to be installed, configured and maintained over time. Each version of Kubernetes can introduce breaking changes. faasd presents a simpler alternative, where clustering and scaling are traded-off in return for a stable system, that can be deployed as an appliance and largely left alone.

faasd combines the following battle-tested components from OpenFaaS and Kubernetes:

* The Core Components of OpenFaaS - the gateway, the queue-worker, Prometheus monitoring
* [containerd](https://containerd.io/) - the container runtime used in Kubernetes
* [Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) - the networking interface used in Kubernetes

Minimum system requirements:

* *x86_64* or *64-bit Arm* CPU architecture
* 512MB-1GB RAM (1GB recommended)
* 2-4 vCPU
* 10-25GB disk space
* The Raspberry Pi 3, 4 & 5 are *also supported*

## Getting started (faasd CE or faasd-pro)

If you want to use faasd for non-commercial, personal use, faasd CE is available for you for free. Up to 15 functions are supported, including private registries and a single namespace. If you need to use faasd for commercial use, you can evaluate a single installation of faasd CE for a period of 60 days.

After that time, you will need to purchase a license for OpenFaaS Edge (faasd-pro).

If you need to use faasd at work, on work time, for a commercial product or service, or for an end-client, then you will need to purchase a license for OpenFaaS Edge (faasd-pro).

* Upgraded Pro components from OpenFaaS Standard: Gateway, Cron Connector, JetStream Queue Worker and Classic Scale to Zero
* Deploy up to 250 functions per installation*
* Configure private DNS servers
* Airgap-friendly with installation bundled in an OCI image or RPM package
* Detailed RAM/CPU metrics for stateful containers, and functions, including Out Of Memory (OOM) events
* Multiple namespace support
* Network policies/segmentation to secure multi-tenant environments

`*` The number of functions is tied to your license, with a maximum of 250 functions per installation.

This version is intended for resale as part of a wider solution, and to be deployed both into industrial and on-premises environments.

## Prerequisites

The quickest and easiest option for trying out faasd is to use a Linux VM from a cloud provider. You can typically create these in a minute or two, and then delete them when you're finished.

If you want to try out faasd on your Mac or Windows machine, then we recommend [Multipass](https://multipass.run/) by Canonical. Multipass is a tool that allows you to create a Linux VM on your Mac or Windows machine.

faasd must not be co-located with Docker, since they both make use of containerd, iptables and CNI, and will clash with one-another. It is designed to be an appliance, and have sole tenancy of any host.

Images should always be built on another host, and pushed to a registry that faasd can subsequently pull from.

A utility script is provided for either version, which can also be run via cloud-init for automated and production deployments.

## OpenFaaS Edge/faasd-pro (commercial use)

Everything required for faasd-pro is packaged in an container image, which makes for easy off-line installation. An RPM package is also available for RHEL-like Operating Systems.

```bash
curl -sLSf \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faasd/refs/heads/master/hack/install-edge.sh \
    -o install-edge.sh && \
chmod +x install-edge.sh
sudo -E ./install-edge.sh
```

*For an offline installation*

Copy the OCI bundle and the install-edge.sh script to the remote server.

Then mirror the various images from docker-compose.yaml into your private registry, and update the references from i.e. `image: ghcr.io/openfaasltd/gateway` to the equivalents in your registry.

If your system is unable to install apt, yum, or pacman packages, due to limited network access, then set the `SKIP_OS` environment to 1. The list of packages is available in the `install_required_packages` section of the script.

## faasd CE (non-commercial use only)

faasd CE supports 15 functions and needs a computer with a stable Internet connection to run. There are restrictions on commercial use, but [individuals](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/EULA.md) can use it for free for personal, non-commercial use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1
cd faasd

./hack/install.sh
```


## Documentation and handbook

For either edition, the complete handbook for faasd ["Serverless For Everyone Else"](https://store.openfaas.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else?layout=profile) is available in the OpenFaaS Store. It contains complete examples for deploying faasd, building functions in Node.js, setting up TLS and custom domains, monitoring, background jobs, and cron schedules.

<a href="https://openfaas.gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">

Any examples of functions on the blog or in the documentation for OpenFaaS on Kubernetes, will generally work with faasd without modification.

Additional topics covered by the handbook:

* Should you deploy to a VPS or Raspberry Pi?
* Deploying your server with bash, cloud-init or terraform
* Using a private container registry
* Finding functions in the store
* Building your first function with Node.js
* Using environment variables for configuration
* Using secrets from functions, and enabling authentication tokens
* Customising templates
* Monitoring your functions with Grafana and Prometheus
* Scheduling invocations and background jobs
* Tuning timeouts, parallelism, running tasks in the background
* Adding TLS to faasd and custom domains for functions
* Self-hosting on your Raspberry Pi
* Adding a database for storage with InfluxDB and Postgresql
* Troubleshooting and logs
* CI/CD with GitHub Actions and multi-arch
* Taking things further, community and case-studies
