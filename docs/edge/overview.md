# OpenFaaS Edge Overview

[OpenFaaS Edge](/deployment/edge) is a commercial distribution of both [OpenFaaS Standard](/docs/openfaas-pro/) and [faasd](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd) designed for redistribution of bespoke solutions to end customers.

The handbook and reference documentation for OpenFaaS Edge are available in the [Serverless for Everyone Else eBook](https://store.openfaas.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else?layout=profile). As a customer, you will receive a 100% discount code for the eBook.
