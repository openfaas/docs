# Authentication for functions

There are two main concerns for authentication for OpenFaaS: the administrative API Gateway API and the individual functions.

## For the API Gateway

When exposing OpenFaaS on the public internet it is important to protect the administrative API endpoints of the API Gateway.

These APIs exist at:

* `/system/`

We recommend using basic authentication and a strong password to protect the `/system/` route, but it is not the only option. If you prefer you can use a reverse proxy project such as [Kong](https://getkong.org/docs/) to enable OAuth or a similar strategy.

The API Gateway as of version 0.8.2 provides built-in basic authentication. To use it set the environmental variable `basic_auth` to true. Then create two secrets named `basic-auth-user` and `basic-auth-password`.

Once basic authentication is enabled you will need to use `faas-cli login` before using the CLI.

## For functions

Functions are exposed at:

* `/function/`
* `/async-function/`

Functions exposed on OpenFaaS often do not need to have authentication enabled, this is because they may be responding to webhooks from an external system such as GitHubÂ or Patreon. Neither GitHub, nor Patreon will support authenticating with OAuth or basic authentication strategies, but rely on HMAC.

HMAC involves a shared symmetric secret - both parties store the key securely. The sender computes a hash of the body of the request with their symmetric key and sends this data to the receiver along with the hash value in the HTTP header. The receiver then computes a hash of the body with their copy of the key and checks that this matches what the sender supplied in the HTTP header. See the reference on [secrets](./secrets.md) for a walk-through on using secret values with functions.
