# Monitoring Functions

## Gateway

The Gateway component exposes several metrics to help you monitor the health and behavior of your functions

| Metric                              | Type       | Description                         | Labels                     | Edition            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |--------------------|
| `gateway_functions_seconds`         | histogram  | Function invocation time taken      | `function_name`            | Community Edition  |
| `gateway_function_invocation_total` | counter    | Function invocation count           | `function_name`, `code`    | Community Edition  |
| `gateway_service_count`             | counter    | Number of function replicas         | `function_name`            | Pro Edition  |
| `gateway_service_target`            | gauge      | Target load for the function        | `function_name`            | Pro Edition  |
| `gateway_service_min`               | gauge      |  Min number of function replicas    | `function_name`            | Pro Edition  |
| `http_request_duration_seconds`     | histogram  | Seconds spent serving HTTP requests | `method`, `path`, `status` | Community Edition  |
| `http_requests_total`               | counter    | The total number of HTTP requests   | `method`, `path`, `status` | Community Edition  |
| `http_requests_total`               | counter    | The total number of HTTP requests   | `method`, `path`, `status` | Community Edition  |


The `http_request*` metrics record the latency and statistics of `/system/*` routes to monitor the OpenFaaS gateway and its provider. The `/async-function` route is also recorded in these metrics to observe asynchronous ingestion rate and latency.

## Examples

These basic metrics can be used to track the health of your functions as well a general usage patterns. See the Prometheus [documentation][prom-query-basics] and [examples][prom-query-examples] for more details about the available options and query functions. Below are several queries you might want to include in a basic [Grafana](https://grafana.com) dashboard for observing your OpenFaaS functions

### Function invocation rate

Return the per-second rate of invocation as measured over the previous 1 minute:

```
rate ( gateway_function_invocation_total [1m])
```

### Function replica count / scaling

Return the total function replicas:

```
gateway_service_count
```

### Total OK Function Invocation

Return the total number of successful function invocations:

```
sum( gateway_function_invocation_total {  code=\"200\"}
```

### Function execution time

Return the average function execution time, as measure over the previous 20 seconds:

```
(rate(gateway_functions_seconds_sum[20s]) / rate(gateway_functions_seconds_count[20s]))
```

### Metrics for a single function

Each of the metrics generated by the Gateway are labeled with and can be filtered by the function name,  For example The invocation rate for just a single function (e.g. if the function name is `echo`) is given by

```
rate ( gateway_function_invocation_total{function_name='echo'} [20s])
```

## Watchdog

The classic and of-watchdog both provide Prometheus instrumentation on TCP port 8081 on the path /metrics. This is to enable the use-case of HPAv2 from the Kubernetes ecosystem.

| Metric                              | Type       | Description                         | Labels                       | Edition            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |--------------------|
| `http_request_duration_seconds`     | histogram  | Seconds spent serving HTTP requests | `method`, `path`, `status`   | Community Edition  |
| `http_requests_total`               | counter    | The total number of HTTP requests   | `method`, `path`, `status`   | Community Edition  |
| `http_requests_in_flight`           | gauge      | The number of HTTP requests in flight | `method`, `path`, `status` | Pro Edition        |

The `http_request*` metrics record the latency and statistics of `/system/*` routes to monitor the OpenFaaS gateway and its provider. The `/async-function` route is also recorded in these metrics to observe asynchronous ingestion rate and latency.
