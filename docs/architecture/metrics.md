# Monitoring Functions

## Gateway

The Gateway component exposes several metrics to help you monitor the health and behavior of your functions

| Metric                              | Type       | Description                         | Labels                     | Edition            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |--------------------|
| `gateway_functions_seconds`         | histogram  | Function invocation time taken      | `function_name`            | Community Edition  |
| `gateway_function_invocation_total` | counter    | Function invocation count           | `function_name`, `code`    | Community Edition  |
| `gateway_service_count`             | counter    | Number of function replicas         | `function_name`            | Community Edition  |
| `gateway_service_target`            | gauge      | Target load for the function        | `function_name`            | Pro Edition  |
| `gateway_service_min`               | gauge      |  Min number of function replicas    | `function_name`            | Pro Edition  |
| `http_request_duration_seconds`     | histogram  | Seconds spent serving HTTP requests | `method`, `path`, `status` | Community Edition  |
| `http_requests_total`               | counter    | The total number of HTTP requests   | `method`, `path`, `status` | Community Edition  |
| `http_requests_total`               | counter    | The total number of HTTP requests   | `method`, `path`, `status` | Community Edition  |


The `http_request*` metrics record the latency and statistics of `/system/*` routes to monitor the OpenFaaS gateway and its provider. The `/async-function` route is also recorded in these metrics to observe asynchronous ingestion rate and latency.

## Examples

These basic metrics can be used to track the health of your functions as well a general usage patterns. See the Prometheus [documentation][prom-query-basics] and [examples][prom-query-examples] for more details about the available options and query functions. Below are several queries you might want to include in a basic [Grafana](https://grafana.com) dashboard for observing your OpenFaaS functions

### Function invocation rate

Return the per-second rate of invocation as measured over the previous 1 minute:

```
rate ( gateway_function_invocation_total [1m])
```

### Function replica count / scaling

Return the total function replicas:

```
gateway_service_count
```

### Total OK Function Invocation

Return the total number of successful function invocations:

```
sum( gateway_function_invocation_total {  code=\"200\"}
```

### Function execution time

Return the average function execution time, as measure over the previous 20 seconds:

```
(rate(gateway_functions_seconds_sum[20s]) / rate(gateway_functions_seconds_count[20s]))
```

### Metrics for a single function

Each of the metrics generated by the Gateway are labeled with and can be filtered by the function name,  For example The invocation rate for just a single function (e.g. if the function name is `echo`) is given by

```
rate ( gateway_function_invocation_total{function_name='echo'} [20s])
```

## Watchdog

The classic and of-watchdog both provide Prometheus instrumentation on TCP port 8081 on the path /metrics. This is to enable the use-case of HPAv2 from the Kubernetes ecosystem.

| Metric                              | Type       | Description                         | Labels                       | Edition            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |--------------------|
| `http_request_duration_seconds`     | histogram  | Seconds spent serving HTTP requests | `method`, `path`, `status`   | Community Edition  |
| `http_requests_total`               | counter    | The total number of HTTP requests   | `method`, `path`, `status`   | Community Edition  |
| `http_requests_in_flight`           | gauge      | The number of HTTP requests in flight | `method`, `path`, `status` | Pro Edition        |

## Provider
The Provider component exposes several metrics.

| Metric                              | Type       | Description                         | Labels                     | Edition            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------|--------------------|
| `provider_http_request_duration_seconds`     | histogram  | Seconds spent serving HTTP requests | `method`, `path`, `code`   | Community Edition  |
| `provider_http_requests_total`               | counter    | The total number of HTTP requests   | `method`, `path`, `code`   | Community Edition  |

The `http_request*` metrics record the latency and statistics of `/system/*` routes. Part of this information is also recorded in the metrics for the Gateway component. The purpose of exposing separate metrics on the provider component is to show the count of calls, to show efficiency, and to show the duration for performance testing, along with errors to flag unseen issues.
