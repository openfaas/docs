## OpenFaaS API Gateway / Portal

Conceptual design using the OpenFaaS operator faas-provider. Each function is built into an immutable Docker image before being deployed via the faas-cli, UI or REST API.

When deployed each function creates 1 to many Pods/containers depending on the minimum and maximum scaling parameters requested by the user. Functions can also scale to zero and back again through use of the [faas-idler](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/faas-idler/) or REST API.

See also: [auto-scaling](autoscaling.md).
