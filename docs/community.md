## Contribute

* How do I become a contributor?

Anyone is invited to contribute to the project in-line with the [contribution guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) - you can also read the guide for ideas on how to get involved. We invite new contributors to join our Slack community. We would also ask you to propose any changes or contributions ahead of time, especially when there is no issue or proposal already tracking it.

Start here: [Contribute to the project](./contributing/get-started.md)

## Press-kit/media/swag

For stickers, swag, media or press-kit information head over to [openfaas/media](https://github.com/openfaas/media/blob/master/README.md)

Please use statistics across the whole GitHub organisation for numbers of contributors, GitHub stars, forks and other activity. OpenFaaS does not operate a mono-repo, so taking statistics just from the (faas) repository is misrepresentation.
