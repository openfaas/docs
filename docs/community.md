# OpenFaaS Community

!!! info "Where is the code for "openfaas"?"

    There are over 40 projects and components which make up the OpenFaaS codebase, so no one repository can be used to track or gauge activity or the total effort of the community.
    
    You can find out aggregate GitHub Stars, commits, forks and contributors and statistics on our project leaderboard (available on request).

## Contributing

* How do I become a contributor?

    If you're considering making a contribution, then we have a [contribution guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) which will help you understand how the process works.

    You may also like the [contributing page](/contributing/get-started) to orient yourself and learn about the various repositories.

Key points:

* Propose your idea in an issue
* Always fill out the whole issue and PR template
* Give the context of why you need this and what company you're working for
* Don't start work on it until you receive approval from a maintainer

Start here: [Contribute to the project](/contributing/get-started)

## Press-kit/media/swag

For stickers, swag, media or press-kit information head over to our [openfaas/media](https://github.com/openfaas/media/blob/master/README.md) repo.

> You may order your own t-shirts and / or stickers with our logo for personal use only, so long as you do not combine it with any other logos, marks or text.

OpenFaaS does not operate a mono-repo, so taking statistics just from the (faas) repository is misrepresentation.

We count statistics across the whole GitHub organisation for numbers of contributors, GitHub stars, forks and etc.
